# Sorting algorithms

## comparing Selection and Bubble Sort
<pre>
1. Selection sort : 
    For every element at i it searches for the minimum element in the rest of the array
    Worst Case Complexity : O(n^2)
    Best Case Complexity : O(n^2)
    Average Case Complexity : O(n^2)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

2. Bubble sort :
    it repeatedly swaps adjacent elements until they are in intended order.Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration.
